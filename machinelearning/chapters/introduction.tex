\section{Introduction}
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and concerned with the question how to make machines able to learn from data. The core idea is to enable a machine to make intelligent decisions and predictions based on experiences from the past. Algorithms of Machine Learning require interdisciplinary knowledge and often intersect with topics of statistics, mathematics, physics, pattern recognition and more.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library for computer vision and comes with a machine learning library for:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Decision Trees
 \item Boosting
 \item Support Vector Machines
 \item Expectation Maximization
 \item Neural Networks
\end{itemize}

This document helps with:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Setting up a development environment in Windows and Linux
 \item Getting Started with CMake and OpenCV
 \item Using the Machine Learning Library of OpenCV
\end{itemize}
A brief introduction to Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks are given. The code example used in this document is available from \url{https://github.com/bytefish/opencv/}.
